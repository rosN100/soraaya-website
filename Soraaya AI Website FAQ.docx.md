* **Minimal switching friction**: Every lead workflow runs through Soraaya—making it nearly impossible to replace

**Is Soraaya AI right for my business?**

If 30%+ of your leads go unanswered in the first contact, or your team spends 20%+ of time on admin/scheduling instead of closing deals, Soraaya AI delivers ROI and is an ideal fit.

**2\. CORE FEATURES & CAPABILITIES**

**What can Soraaya AI do?**

Soraaya AI handles the full customer engagement lifecycle:

1. **Instant Lead Engagement**: Answers calls/messages within seconds, 24/7 (never misses a lead)

2. **Intelligent Qualification**: Asks contextual questions about budget, location, timeline, preferences, or specific needs

3. **Emotion Detection**: Reads urgency and intent from voice tone; escalates hot leads immediately to agents

4. **Smart Routing**: Qualified leads → booked directly to agent calendar; uncertain cases → escalated to human; unqualified → tagged for follow-up

5. **Automatic Follow-up**: Voice reminders and retargeting for cold leads

6. **CRM Integration**: Every conversation logged in real-time; no manual data entry

7. **Call Scoring & Analytics**: Built-in performance tracking for team improvement

8. **Dynamic Script Adaptation**: Adjusts messaging based on campaign goals and lead behaviour

**How does lead qualification work?**

When a lead contacts you:

1. **Instant Response**: Soraaya engages the caller within seconds (no "hold" messages)

2. **Context Gathering**: Asks key questions—budget range, desired location, move timeline, specific requirements

3. **Intent Recognition**: Analyses voice tone and responses to detect urgency and genuine interest

4. **Smart Decision**:

   * **Hot Lead** → Directly books an appointment with an available agent; Soraaya informs the agent in real-time

   * **Possible Lead** → Escalates to agent via call/text for human judgment

   * **Not Qualified** → Tags for nurture track; logs for later follow-up

**Can Soraaya AI handle complex conversations?**

Yes. Soraaya recognises when a conversation exceeds its scope and seamlessly transfers to a human agent, providing context so the agent picks up mid-conversation without repeating information. This "hand-off with dignity" ensures every caller feels heard.

**What languages does Soraaya AI support?**

Soraaya is currently optimised for English with market-specific accents (Indian English, US English, British English, Australian English). Support for additional languages is on the roadmap for Q1-Q3 2026\.

**Does Soraaya AI work with video or text channels?**

Today, Soraaya is voice-first (phone calls are 70%+ of qualified inbound in real estate/hospitality). WhatsApp integrations are under development for Q3 2025, enabling multi-channel consistency while maintaining voice as the primary conversion channel.

---

**3\. INTEGRATION & TECHNOLOGY**

**Which CRM systems does Soraaya integrate with?**

Soraaya supports API integration with most of the CRM providers, Property Management Systems (PMS), and Booking Engines.

Every conversation (with permission) syncs to your CRM in real-time—no data silos.

**How does Soraaya integrate with my phone system?**

Soraaya integrates with modern VoIP/telephony platforms:

1. **Twilio** (most common for flexibility)

2. **Our Partners in India**

Setup is typically complete within 24-48 hours. Existing call flows continue uninterrupted—Soraaya answers when agents aren't available.

**What data is collected during calls?**

Soraaya captures:

1. **Call metadata**: Duration, timestamp, caller number (encrypted), outcome

2. **Transcription**: Full conversation transcript (searchable, indexed)

3. **Qualification data**: Lead info, budget, timeline, preferences, intent signals

4. **Voice analysis**: Tone, urgency indicators, sentiment

5. **Routing decision**: Was the lead routed to the agent? If not, why?

6. **Outcome**: Appointment booked? Follow-up needed? Not qualified?.

All data is encrypted in transit and at rest; compliant and local privacy laws are built in.

**Is my data secure?**

Yes. We do not store, sell or share your data. Conversations belong entirely to you\[

---

**4\. REAL ESTATE SPECIFIC**

**How does Soraaya AI help real estate agents?**

**Soraaya solves three core RE problems:**

1. **The Missed Call Crisis**: 40-50% of inbound calls are missed by busy agents. Soraaya answers every call within seconds—leads reached within 5 minutes are 21x more likely to convert.

2. **The Admin Drain**: Agents waste 20-30% of their day on scheduling, data entry, and follow-ups. Soraaya automates all of this; agents focus only on viewings and closing.

3. **The Churn Disaster**: Real estate has 15-25% annual agent turnover. When agents leave, client history vanishes. Soraaya *is* your institutional memory—clients stay engaged regardless of team changes.

**What questions does Soraaya ask buyers/sellers?**

Soraaya asks contextual, natural questions that flow like a human agent:

**For Buyer Inquiries:**

* "What's your budget range?"

* "Are you looking in \[specific area\] or open to other neighbourhoods?"

* "What's your timeline—are you looking to move in the next 30 days, 60 days, or still exploring?"

* "What matters most—square footage, proximity to schools, parking, renovated kitchen?"

**For Seller Inquiries:**

* "Is your property currently listed, or are you in the pre-listing phase?"

* "What's your ideal sale timeline?"

* "Have you had a professional appraisal or market analysis?".

**For Rental Inquiries:**

* "What's your budget per month?"

* "How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need?"

* "Move-in date?"

* "Any must-haves—gym, parking, pet-friendly?"

Agents can customise these questions per campaign or property type.

**Can Soraaya show properties or schedule viewings?**

Soraaya can:

1. **Describe properties** in detail using your listing database (pulled in real-time)

2. **Check agent availability** and automatically book viewing appointments in agent calendars (Calendly, Google Calendar, Outlook)

3. **Send confirmation & directions** to the buyer with property details, agent contact, and turn-by-turn directions

4. **Schedule follow-ups** if a viewing is missed or needs rescheduling

Soraaya cannot physically show properties, but it orchestrates the entire flow—eliminating back-and-forth emails.

**How much time does Soraaya save agents?**

**Industry benchmark data from Soraaya pilots.:**

1. **15-20 hours per week per agent**: Saved on admin, scheduling, and initial qualification calls

2. **65-75% of leads pre-qualified** before the agent takes the call (agent focuses on high-intent conversations)

3. **Zero rescheduling friction**: Appointments booked automatically—no missed time slots

4. **3-4 extra closings per agent per month** (from better lead flow \+ more agent focus time).

**Financial impact**: For a 10-agent team, this translates to \~$150K-$200K in productivity gains annually (factoring agent cost \+ commission structure).

**What's the typical ROI for real estate firms?**

**Soraaya pricing model.:**

* **Base subscription**: $500-$2,500/month per agent (scales with team size)

* **Usage fee**: $0.15-$0.25 per qualified call (pay only for engaged leads)

* **Setup/onboarding**: One-time $2,000-$5,000

**ROI breakeven** (typical 5-10 agent agency):

* Costs: \~$1,200/month \+ $200 in calls \= $1,400/month

* Savings: \~3-4 extra commissions per month \= $3,000-$5,000 (at 2.5% commission on $400K median)

* **Payback: 2-4 weeks**

Long-term LTV is high because of switching costs—every workflow runs through Soraaya.

**Does Soraaya work with Zillow, Trulia, or other listing portals?**

Yes. Soraaya can:

1. **Monitor Zillow leads** and engage them with Soraaya (capturing leads before competitors)

2. **Route to the appropriate agent** based on property type or agent specialisation 

3. **Sync listing data** to keep property descriptions current

4. **Track lead source** for attribution (Zillow vs. organic vs. social)

**Important**: Zillow's lead-sharing API means third-party tools like Soraaya enhance—not replace—your Zillow CRM integration.

**Can I use Soraaya for luxury properties?**

Absolutely. Luxury sales require more finesse—not fewer touches. Soraaya:

1. **Understands luxury language**: Uses sophisticated, upscale terminology

2. **Qualifies high-intent buyers only**: Avoids low-ball or window-shopping callers

3. **Preserves agent relationships**: Handles initial calls; transfers sophisticated negotiations to agents

4. **Integrates with luxury-specific tools**: Christie's International Real Estate, Sotheby's International Realty APIs

Luxury teams in Dubai, Mumbai, and Los Angeles use Soraaya today.

**5\. HOSPITALITY SPECIFIC**

**How does Soraaya AI help hotels and resorts?**

**Soraaya solves three core hospitality challenges:**

1. **After-Hours Booking Loss**: 30-40% of hotel inquiries come outside business hours (9 PM-7 AM). Soraaya captures these and converts them to confirmed reservations

2. **Front Desk Overflow**: Peak season overwhelms front desk staff. Soraaya handles routine inquiries—room availability, rate checks, amenities—freeing staff for premium guest service

3. **Upsell Opportunity**: Soraaya identifies upgrade-ready guests and suggests premium experiences (suites, spa packages, dining reservations) during initial contact

**What guest inquiries can Soraaya handle?**

Soraaya handles:

1. **"Do you have availability for \[dates\]?"** → Checks PMS in real-time, shows available room types

2. **"What's the rate for a double room?"** → Retrieves dynamic pricing; can highlight package deals

3. **"Is your restaurant open for dinner?"** → Accesses amenity database; can pre-book dining

4. **"Do you offer airport transfers?"** → Explains services; can arrange pre-arrival logistics

5. **"What's your pet policy?"** → Retrieves property rules; asks about service/emotional support animals

6. **"Can I extend my stay?"** → Checks extended dates in PMS; books if available

7. **"I need a quiet room away from the elevator"** → Notes preferences; forwards to housekeeping

Routine questions → Soraaya handles end-to-end. Complex requests → Escalates to concierge/manager.

**Does Soraaya integrate with hotel PMS?**

Yes. Soraaya reads PMS data in real-time—no delays, always accurate availability and rates.

**Can Soraaya book reservations directly?**

Not as of now, Soraaya can collect details and route to the manager for final confirmation, giving guests the personal touch with AI speed.

1. **Confirmation email** sent instantly with booking reference, check-in instructions, and property details\[2\]

2. **PMS auto-update** → Reservation appears in your system immediately\[2\]

3. **upsell opportunities** → "Would you like us to reserve a table at our restaurant?" or "Add spa package?"\[2\]

**How does Soraaya handle night auditor calls?**

Night auditors are often overwhelmed from 11 PM-7 AM. Soraaya:

1. **Answers incoming guest calls** (in-room phone transfers to Soraaya during off-hours)

2. **Handles common night requests**: Extra towels, room temperature adjustment, late-night dining, taxi booking

3. **Logs all requests** in PMS—morning staff reviews and executes follow-ups

4. **Flags urgent issues**: Noise complaints, maintenance problems → Immediate escalation to night manager

Net result: Night auditor can focus on revenue-critical tasks (walk-in negotiations, billing disputes) instead of routine calls.

**What's the impact on guest satisfaction?**

**From hospitality studies:**

1. **Guest satisfaction**: 85%+ of guests prefer instant AI booking over waiting for a callback

2. **NPS improvement**: \+15-20 points when after-hours inquiry \= immediate booking confirmation

3. **upsell revenue**: AI-driven suggestions during booking add 12-18% per reservation

4. **Staff morale**: Front desk teams report 30%+ less stress; fewer repeat calls about status

Guests don't feel "replaced"—they feel prioritised (instant response, personalised service).

**Can Soraaya handle multiple properties (multi-property operators)?**

Yes. Soraaya can:

1. **Route calls** to correct the property based on customer intent

2. **Maintain separate databases** per property (rates, amenities, availability)

3. **Cross-property upselling**: "Our sister property in \[location\] has these rates; would you prefer?"

4. **Unified analytics**: Dashboard shows occupancy, upsell revenue, and guest satisfaction across the portfolio

Co-working spaces, hostel chains, and resort groups benefit significantly from multi-property orchestration.

**6\. IMPLEMENTATION & SETUP**

**How long does it take to implement Soraaya AI?**

**Typical timeline:**

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities |
| :---- | :---: | :---: |
| Onboarding | 1-2 days | Collect CRM/PMS credentials, phone routing setup, and compliance check |
| Data Training | 3-5 days | Ingest property/room data, create a knowledge base, and set call flows |
| Testing | 3-7 days | QA with your team, refine scripts, adjust qualification logic |
| Soft Launch | 1-2 weeks | Route 25-50% of calls to Soraaya; monitor quality, iterate |
| Full Launch | Ongoing | 100% call routing; continuous learning kicks in |

Table 1: Typical Soraaya AI implementation timeline

**Total time to full deployment: 2-4 weeks,** depending on workflow complexity and team readiness.

**What information do I need to provide for setup?**

You'll need to share:

1. **CRM login credentials** (read/write access to lead and contact data).

2. **Property or room database** (listings, descriptions, pricing, availability).

3. **Phone routing details** (current phone numbers, VoIP provider).

4. **Call flow preferences** (how do you want leads routed? What questions matter?).

5. **Compliance requirements** (industry regulations, data residency preferences).

6. **Team structure** (agent availability, escalation preferences).

7. **Brand guidelines** (tone, language style, any corporate messaging).

All data is handled securely under NDA and encryption.

**Can Soraaya work with my existing phone number?**

Yes. Your existing number continues to work:

1. **Number porting**: If you want Soraaya to handle the number directly, we can facilitate the port (no downtime).

2. **Call forwarding**: If you prefer your existing carrier, we integrate via forwarding rules.

3. **Hybrid setup**: Some calls route to Soraaya (off-hours, specific campaigns); others to your team.

Zero disruption to your existing telephony infrastructure.

**What if I want to go back to my previous system?**

Soraaya is designed to reduce switching costs and make you sticky through deep workflow integration. However, if you choose to leave:

1. **60-day notice**: Standard contract terms (terms vary by agreement).

2. **Data export**: All call transcripts, lead data, and analytics exported to CSV/JSON format.

3. **Clean separation**: Your phone number ported back; no lingering integrations.

In practice, high LTV and low churn suggest most teams stay for years. The data flywheel (AI gets smarter with scale) is the stickiness factor.

**7\. PRICING & ROI**

**What is Soraaya AI's pricing model?**

Soraaya uses a **hybrid model** (predictable \+ usage-based). Book a Demo Call with us to know more.

**Do you offer discounts for long-term contracts?**

Yes. Book a Demo Call to discuss with our Founders.

**Can I scale up or down mid-contract?**

1. **Scale up (add agents/properties)**: Effective immediately; prorated for partial months

2. **Scale down (reduce agents/properties)**: 30-day notice; no early termination fees.

3. **Pausing (e.g., seasonal)**: Pause feature for off-season; resume without penalty.

Flexibility is built in because Soraaya prioritises long-term partnerships over lock-in.

---

**8\. PERFORMANCE & ANALYTICS**

**How do I track Soraaya's performance?**

Soraaya provides a comprehensive dashboard with:

1. **Call volume**: Total calls, qualified calls, routed calls, duration.

2. **Conversion metrics**: Appointments booked, reservation confirmations, and upsells captured.

3. **Call transcripts**: Searchable, tagged by outcome and intent.

4. **Agent performance**: Which agents convert routed leads best? (identifies top performers).

5. **ROI tracking**: Estimated revenue impact, payback period, breakeven analysis.

6. **Quality scores**: Call quality, sentiment analysis, script effectiveness.

7. **Lead lifecycle**: Track a lead from first call through close (funnel view).

Dashboard updates in real-time; exportable reports available daily, weekly, or monthly..

**What metrics should I monitor?**

**Critical metrics for Real Estate:**

1. **Qualified Lead Rate**: What % of inbound calls Soraaya qualifies (target: 60-75%)

2. **Conversion Rate**: % of qualified leads that book appointments (target: 40-60%)

3. **Agent Conversion Rate**: % of routed leads agents close (compare vs. historical)

4. **Response Time**: Avg. time to first engagement (Soraaya: \<2 sec vs. agents: 20-60 sec)

5. **Call Resolution**: % of calls Soraaya fully resolves without escalation (target: 40-50%)

6. **Revenue Lift**: Additional commission from faster, more numerous leads.

**Critical metrics for Hospitality:**

1. **Occupancy Rate**: Does Soraaya drive higher occupancy (esp. off-peak)?

2. **After-Hours Booking %**: % of total bookings from 11 PM-7 AM (target: 20-30%)

3. **upsell Capture Rate**: What % of guests accept room upgrade or ancillary offers?

4. **Guest Satisfaction (NPS)**: Do guests feel heard by Soraaya? (target: NPS 50+)

5. **Cost per Booking**: How much did AI cost vs. staff handling? (AI is typically 60-70% cheaper)

6. **Staff Time Freed**: How many hours per week did Soraaya save front desk?

**PRO TIP**: Establish baseline metrics in Week 1, then compare quarterly.

**How does Soraaya improve over time?**

Soraaya's competitive advantage is the **learning loop**.:

1. **Call 1**: Soraaya engages; you review the transcript

2. **Calls 2-10**: Patterns emerge; Soraaya adapts tone based on what works

3. **Calls 11-100**: Soraaya has seen 100 variations of "Is the place pet-friendly?"—responds like an expert

4. **Calls 101+**: Soraaya predicts objections before they're raised; converts more leads.

This learning is proprietary—**your data is your moat**. Over 12-24 months, top-performing teams see:

* 15-25% quarter-over-quarter improvement in conversion

* 30-50% reduction in agent follow-up burden

* Industry-leading response time (Soraaya is faster than 99% of competitors).

---

**Is Soraaya compliant with real estate regulations?**

Yes, including:

1. **Fair Housing Act (FHA)**: Soraaya does not discriminate based on protected characteristics (race, religion, familial status, etc.). Qualification logic is reviewed quarterly.

2. **Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)**: Call recording requires prior consent; do-not-call lists honoured.

3. **State licensing**: Soraaya does not perform licensed real estate activities (it qualifies, not appraises or contracts).

4. **MLS compliance**: Data sharing with MLS systems follows MLS privacy rules.

Each market (US, UAE, India, Australia) has regional compliance reviews built into the contract.

**Is Soraaya compliant for hospitality?**

Yes:

1. **PCI DSS Level 1**: Safe for processing guest payments

2. **ADA Compliance**: Soraaya meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility

3. **Data Protection**: Guest data subject to hospitality privacy frameworks (varies by region)

4. **Recording Consent**: Call recording disclosed upfront; guests can opt out

---

**10\. OBJECTION HANDLING & EDGE CASES**

**"What if Soraaya makes a mistake on a call?"**

Soraaya escalates complex cases to humans, but mistakes can happen. Here's how Soraaya handles errors:

1. **Immediate escalation**: If Soraaya detects uncertainty, it transfers to the agent (doesn't guess).

2. **Transcript review**: Your team reviews every call; mistakes are logged and corrected.

3. **Retraining**: Soraaya learns from mistakes via a feedback loop—the same error won't repeat.

4. **SLA**: Mistakes resulting in lost leads are tracked; Soraaya's performance is measured against them.

In practice, Soraaya's error rate decreases rapidly (Week 1: \~5% errors → Month 3: \~1% errors) as the learning loop kicks in.

**"What if a caller is angry or upset?"**

Soraaya detects emotional distress and:

1. **Recognises anger/frustration** from voice tone analysis.

2. **Adjusts tone** to be empathetic, not robotic.

3. **Immediately offers escalation**: "I understand your concern. Let me connect you with my manager."

4. **Logs sentiment**: Your team knows the caller was upset before they pick up.

**Pro practice**: Train Soraaya on how *your* top agent handles upset callers—Soraaya will mirror that approach.

**"What if a caller has an accent Soraaya doesn't recognise?"**

Soraaya's speech recognition improves with exposure. For new accents:

1. **First call**: Recognition accuracy \~85%; may ask for clarification.

2. **Calls 2-5**: Accuracy improves to \~92% as the acoustic model adapts.

3. **Calls 6+**: Soraaya converges on the caller's accent; accuracy 95%+.

4. **Manual override**: If Soraaya misunderstands, the caller can say "repeat that" or spell it out.

Markets like India, UAE, and Australia are production-ready. New accents get flagged for model improvement.

**"What if my property prices change hourly (hotels)?"**

Soraaya syncs in real-time:

1. **Dynamic pricing**: Soraaya pulls rates from your PMS every 5 minutes.

2. **Live availability**: When a room is booked by another system, Soraaya's next call knows it's gone.

3. **Rate fencing**: Soraaya applies business rules (e.g., "no discounts on weekends") automatically.

**"What if I need to remove or change call scripts mid-campaign?"**

Scripts update instantly:

1. **Dashboard-based updates**: Change any question or response in real-time.

2. **Version control**: Old scripts retained; rollback available if needed.

3. **A/B testing**: Compare two script versions' conversion rates side-by-side.

4. **Immediate deployment**: New script takes effect on the next incoming call.

No coding required; non-technical team members can update scripts.

**"What about AI hallucination? Can Soraaya invent information?"**

Soraaya is built to avoid hallucination:

1. **Knowledge base only**: Soraaya answers ONLY from the property/CRM data you provide (strict guardrails).

2. **Source attribution**: Every answer cites where it came from (e.g., "Based on your MLS listing...".

3. **Uncertainty handling**: When unsure, Soraaya says, "Let me connect you with my manager" instead of guessing.

4. **Continuous monitoring**: Quality assurance team monitors calls for hallucinations; responds immediately.

Risk of hallucination is \<1% after the first 50 calls because Soraaya is domain-specific and data-grounded.

---

**12\. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING**

**How does Soraaya compare to Vapi, Voiceflow, or Gnani?**

Soraaya's advantage is *verticalization*. While competitors offer flexible automation, Soraaya is pre-trained for real estate/hospitality—meaning faster implementation, fewer mistakes, and a proprietary data flywheel that makes your AI smarter than competitors' over time.

**Why should I choose Soraaya over a larger competitor?**

Three reasons:

1. **Domain Expertise**: Soraaya's founders have deep RE/hospitality ops experience; other platforms are built by engineers for engineers.

2. **Speed to Value**: 2-4 week deployment vs. 3-6 months for horizontal platforms. ROI payback in 2-4 weeks.

3. **Customer Success**: Dedicated CSM \+ founder-accessible team. You're not a ticket number.

Larger competitors (Twilio, Amazon) can't customise for one vertical; smaller competitors lack the team or funding. Soraaya is the "Goldilocks" option—specialised enough to be fast, resourced enough to scale.
